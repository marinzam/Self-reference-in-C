Lab17 C Linked Lists
This lab continued our practice using the C language and creating a struct (Node) that has a value and a pointer to another Node. When a pointer to a node is created, a struct Node is automatically made with a pointer to NULL. Using the methods in the program, one can insert a node to this ‘list’ or delete a node, thereby creating a Linked List using pointers.
